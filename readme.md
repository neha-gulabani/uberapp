If you're using a physical device to run the app and if the device is android, check the settings of the Expo Go app and check the location permissions. The location permissions should be set to 'Ask everytime' so the current location can be requested and accessed. 

Type 'npm install' before running to install all necessary libraries.

Type 'expo start' in command prompt or terminal to run the app.

For running in expo snacks, kindly copy the api key from the env file and paste it into the following files in the expo snack:
> HomeScreen.js
>Maps.js
>NavigationCards.js


In these files, I have indicated where to paste the api key with the help of comments. This is only for running the app in expo snack.
